# Temporal Shift and Predictive Performance of Machine Learning for Heart Transplant Outcomes

## Installation

```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv install --dev
jupyter notebook
```

## How to

- Pipelines are stored in `./heart_transplant_evaluate_*.py`
 
- Results are shown in `./results.ipynb` (https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/HCVE/unos-ml/blob/master/results.ipynb).

- The unos data are not part of this repo. You need to put them into `../unos-data/unos.csv`
